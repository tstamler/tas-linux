\section{Conclusion}

The continuing increase in data center link bandwidth, coupled with a
much slower improvement in CPU performance, is threatening the
viability of kernel software TCP processing, pushing researchers to
investigate alternative solutions. Any alternative has to ensure that
it is safe, efficient, scalable, and flexible.

We present \taas, TCP acceleration as a software service. \taas
executes common-case TCP operation in a linearized fast path, while
handling corner cases in a slow path.  \taas achieves throughput up to
4.5$\times$ that of Linux and up to 1.5$\times$ that of IX for common
cloud applications.
% A further 1.6 speedup is possible on some applications through
% object steering on the NIC.
Unlike kernel bypass, \taas enforces congestion control on untrusted
applications, and achieves much higher levels of per-flow fairness
than Linux. \taas scales to many cores and connections, while being
flexible to further TCP protocol innovation.
