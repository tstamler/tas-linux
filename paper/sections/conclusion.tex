%*No loss of performance on fast path

Integrating kernel functionality into TAS did not affect the fast path operations, which is where
it gets most of its performance benefits.
%*Slow path is hit, but is not frequent
The slow path took a hit in performance due to proxying system calls and having to 
read/write from a TAP device on every slow path
operation, which incurs overhead from constant mode switches.
%*Goal was to add functionality, not increase performance
However, because slow path operations are infrequent, we think that the tradeoff of slower connection setup
and teardown is worth it to add powerful kernel network functionality such as firewalls and congestion control without
having to reimplement it in user space.
