\section{Future Work}\label{Future}

Our design and implementation of Linux-Integrated TAS can handle slow path
operations such as connection setup/teardown as well as ARP packets. However,
there is additional slow path functionality that we leave to future work.

\subsection{Congestion Control}
The slow path can take advantage of Linux's policies for congestion control
and forward this information to the fast path for enforcement. This would entail
forwarding packets with ECN bits set between Linux and the slow path. The slow
path would then observe Linux's response to the network congestion and mimic
it.

\subsection{Connection Timeouts}
The slow path needs to occasionally send packets to Linux to allow Linux to keep
its connections from timing out. Additionally, Linux may want to timeout
connections for other reasons; the slow path could examine Linux's response and
decide if it wants to do the same.
