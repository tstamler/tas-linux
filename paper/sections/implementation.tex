\section{Implementation}

Tap creation and packet parsing
 -save MAC address
 -seperate thread epoll on the tap device
 -identify packets/ lookup connections

Slow path tap control interface
 -reversed control interface
  -reverse IP, MAC address, sequence/ack nos, and tcp options
 -override MAC address

Slow path raw network interface
 -only connection based before

ARP Support
 -can receive ARP packets from Linux
 -lookup in SplitTCP's ARP tables
 -Craft a response

Connection Setup
 -dual socket library (socket, bind, fcntl, setsockopt, listen, accept)
 -SYN already goes to slow path
 -Linux will use ARP support for client MAC
 -instead of having slow path asynchronously handle SYNACK, wait for Linux
 -read SYNACK from tap, write to network and write ACK to tap
